# Bookstore_Data-Structure
This repository showcases implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python, emphasizing real-life applications. 

The "Calculator" demonstrates the usage of stacks, hash tables, and binary trees for defining and evaluating mathematical expressions. 

The "BookStore System" utilizes various data structures such as queues, lists, hash tables, binary search trees, heaps, graphs, and sorting to manage a bookstore's inventory and shopping cart functionalities. The system allows users to search for best-selling books efficiently, leveraging binary search trees or binary heaps based on user preference. Each module includes detailed implementations and thorough testing scenarios, providing a comprehensive learning resource for data structure implementations and problem-solving skills.
